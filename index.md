The goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying language comprehension and production in both a native language (L1) and a second language (L2).

My main interests center around the following thwo areas:

- 1. Referential color and number redundancy 
- 2. Acquisition of attributive adjective placement in L2 French
