<div style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.4;">

The goal of my research is to understand the mechanisms underlying language comprehension and production in both a native language (L1) and a second language (L2).

My main interests center around the following two areas:

* **Referential color and number redundancy** I investigate how linguistic factors...
* **Acquisition of attributive adjective placement in L2 French** I use experimental paradigms...

You can find a comprehensive overview in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/...).
